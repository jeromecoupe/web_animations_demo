# Web animations demos

Quick demos of animations with a simple login example.

## GSAP animations

`master` branch.

The goal here is to explain the basics of GSAP to beginners and to showcase how to create and manage complex timeline animations by using functions and nested timelines.

`waapi` branch.

Works fine in Chrome with polyfill but still problems in other browsers.
